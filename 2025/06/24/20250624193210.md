-## PyGhidra
-The PyGhidra Python library, originally developed by the Department of Defense Cyber Crime Center 
-(DC3) under the name *Pyhidra*, is a Python library that provides direct access to the Ghidra API 
-within a native CPython 3 interpreter using JPype. PyGhidra contains some conveniences for setting 
-up analysis on a given sample and running a Ghidra script locally. It also contains a Ghidra plugin 
-to allow the use of CPython 3 from the Ghidra GUI.
-
-To launch Ghidra in PyGhidra mode, run `./support/pyghidra` (or `support\pyghidra.bat`). See the
-*"PyGhidra Mode"* section of the *Getting Started* document and `Ghidra/Features/PyGhidra/README.html`
-for more information.
-
-## Visual Studio Code
-Ghidra 11.2 introduced a `VSCodeProjectScript.java` GhidraScript to assist in setting up Visual Studio Code
-project folders for Ghidra module development and debugging. This GhidraScript has been replaced in 
-Ghidra 11.3 by 2 new actions, accessible from a *CodeBrowser* tool:
-+ *Tools -> Create VSCode Module Project...*
-+ "*Edit Script with Visual Studio Code*" button in the Script Manager
-
-The "*Create VSCode Module Project...*" action provides the same capability as the old
-`VSCodeProjectScript.java` GhidraScript, creating a Visual Studio Code project folder that contains a
-skeleton module which can be used to build a variety of different Ghidra extension points
-(Plugins, Analyzers, Loaders, etc). Launchers are also provided to run and debug the module in
-Ghidra, as well as a Gradle task to export the module as a distributable Ghidra extension zip file.
-
-The "*Edit Script with Visual Studio Code*" button in the Script Manager enables quick editing and
-debugging of the selected script in a Visual Studio Code workspace that is automatically created
-behind the scenes in Ghidra's user settings directory. This provides a much snappier and modern
-alternative to Eclipse, while maintaining all of the core fuctionality you would expect from an IDE
-(auto complete, hover, navigation, etc).
-
-Ghidra will do its best to automatically locate your Visual Studio Code installation, but if cannot
-find it, it can be set via the Front-End GUI at *Edit -> Tool Options -> Visual Studio Code
-Integration*.
+
+## Search
+
+A new "Search and Replace" feature allows searching for string patterns in a wide variety
+of Ghidra elements and replacing that text with a different text sequence. Using this feature, many different
+Ghidra elements can be renamed all at once including labels, functions, name-spaces, parameters, data-types,
+field names, and enum values. This feature also supports regular expressions (including capture groups).
+After initiating a search and replace, a results table is displayed with a list of items that match the
+search. From this table, the replace actions can be applied in bulk or individually, one item at a time
+as they are reviewed.
+
+## Taint Engine Support
+
+Extended support for using taint engines, particularly CTADL (https://github.com/sandialabs/ctadl)
+and AngryGhidra (https://github.com/Nalen98/AngryGhidra), from the decompiler. Allows users to mark
+pcode varnodes as sources and sinks, displaying paths from sources to sinks as both address selections
+in the disassembly and token selections in the decompiler.
+
+## Dockerized Ghidra
+
+A new capability to build a docker image that demonstrates Ghidra's various entrypoint executions for `headless`,
+`ghidra-server`, `bsim-server`, `bsim`, `pyghidra`, and `gui` within the docker container has been included. The Docker
+image can be used as is, or can be tailored to your workflow needs.   Configuration such as the base
+image (linux distro), additional packages, and more is possible using Docker.
+
+See the `docker/README.md` for information about building a docker image for Ghidra and running within the Ghidra container. 
+
+
+## Binary Formats
+
++ New loaders for the a.out and OMF-51 binary file formats.
++ Support for Mach-O "re-exports".
++ New ability to load Mach-O binaries directly from a Universal Binary without needing to open the File System Browser.
++ DWARF will now load external debug files during analysis as is done for PDB files.
 
 ## Debugger
-The old "IN-VM" and "GADP" launchers and connectors have been removed, as their replacement
-TraceRmi-based implementations have been satisfactorily completed. On that same note, the entire API
-and supporting code base for IN-VM and GADP connectors have been removed.
-
-We've begun to explore more kernel-level debugging. Our lldb connector can now debug the macOS 
-kernel, and our dbgeng connector can now debug a Windows kernel running in a VM via eXDI.
-
-## Emulator
-We have introduced a new accelerated p-code emulator that uses Jit-in-Time translation (JIT). 
-This is *not* currently integrated in the UI but is available for scripting and plugin developers. 
-Its implementation is named `JitPcodeEmulator`, and it's a near drop-in replacement for `PcodeEmulator`. 
-See its javadoc for usage and implementation details. The JIT emulator is very new, so there may 
-still be many bugs.
-
-## Source File Information
-Source file and line information can now be added to Ghidra using a Program's SourceFileManager. 
-The DWARF, PDB, and Go analyzers now record this information by default. Source information can also
-be added programmatically; see the example scripts in the *SourceMapping* script category. 
-Source information can be viewed in the *"Source Map"* Listing Field or the `SourceFilesTablePlugin`, 
-which is accessible from the Code Browser via *Window -> Source Files and Transforms*.
-
-The *"View Source..."* Listing action, enabled on addresses with source file information, opens a 
-source file at the correct line in either Eclipse or Visual Studio Code (there is a *"Source Files 
-and Transforms"* tool option to determine the viewer). The SourceFilesTablePlugin can be used to 
-modify the source file paths stored in the SourceFileManager before sending them to Eclipse or 
-Visual Studio Code.
-
-## Function Graph
-The Function Graph has had a number of improvements:
-+ Added new *"Flow Chart"* layouts
-+ Position of the satellite view can be configured
-+ Ctrl-Space toggles between the Listing and the Function Graph (starting fully zoomed in vs. fully
-  zoomed out is controlled by a Function Graph option)
-
-## String Translation and Text Search
-+ String translation has an additional translator available using the LibreTranslate service.
-  The LibreTranslate project (currently hosted at libretranslate.com) is an independent project
-  that provides an open source translation package that can be self-hosted, meaning you can translate
-  strings without sending them to a second party to translate, using an existing LibreTranslate server.
-  For more information search for LibreTranslate in the online Ghidra help pages.
-  **NOTE:** The LibreTranslate plugin is not enabled by default, and is added in the 
-  *File -> Configure* menu.
-
-+ The ability to search the text of all decompiled functions has been added.  Decompilation during
-  search occurs on the fly, so the latest decompilation results of all functions are used for the
-  search.  The search can take some time depending on the number and size of functions in your binary.
-  The new action can be found at *Search -> Decompiled Text...*.
+
+There have been numerous improvements, extensions for new targets, better launching and configuration, and bug fixes to the debugger.
+
+## Analysis Speed
+
+Constant and Stack analysis time has been greatly decreased through algorithm improvements and better threading.  There has been additional
+work to loosen locking of the program database where possible.  By locking only when necessary, multiple threads can better analyze the program
+and interaction with the GUI during analysis should be more responsive.
+
+## Golang
+
+Golang binary analysis analysis has been improved.
++ Analysis has been improved to model closures, interface methods, and generic functions more accurately.
++ Function signatures for core golang library functions are automatically applied.
++ Decompilation results are improved by filtering some verbose golang garbage collection function logic.
++ Addressed finding the Golang bootstrap information in stripped PE binaries.
+
+## BSim
+
+PostgreSQL for BSim has been updated to version 15.13 and the JDBC driver to 42.7.6.  This resolves issues with building PostgreSQL
+server on newer releases of Linux and compiler toolchains which compile with -std=c23 option by default.  In addition,
+building of PostgreSQL for linux_arm_64 and mac_arm_64 based platforms is supported.
+
++ BSim is now installed in the default Codebrowser tool.
++ Function names now update in BSim search results overview if the name is changed elsewhere in Ghidra.
 
 ## Processors
-+ The x86 EVEX instruction write and read masking has been implemented for all AVX-512 instructions.
-  The handling of the mask is necessary as semantics are added for individual AVX-512 instructions.
-+ TI_MSP430 decompilation has been improved through numerous changes to the processor's compiler
-  specifications file.
-+ Corrected ARM VFPv2 instructions which were not disassembling correctly.
-
-## Other Improvements 
-+ Much of Ghidra's standalone documentation has been modernized to the Markdown format. Generated 
-  HTML versions are provided alongside the Markdown files for convenience. Converting all relevant
-  documents to Markdown remains an ongoing process.  **NOTE:** There are no plans to convert the
-  internal Ghidra help system to Markdown, as the Java Help library does not support it.
-+ Libraries can now be loaded into an already-imported program with the *File -> Load Libraries...*
-  action.
-+ The CParser macro pre-processing will now halt on *"#error"* directives.  This change had a ripple
-  effect and uncovered a myriad of bugs which have been addressed.  In addition, the interim parsing
-  output has been improved to allow easier diagnosis when problems in parsing occur due to incorrect
-  define values or other header file issues.
-+ Finally, a new `CreateUEFIGDTArchivesScript.java` parsing script has been added to parse UEFI header files
-  available from `github.com/tianocore/edk2`.  Using a script vice released pre-parsed GDT files allows the
-  end user to parse the correct version with a configuration fitting their needs.
+
++ Enhanced support for the x86 AVX-512 processor extension with additional instruction support - including the BF16, FP16 and VNNI extensions.
++ Implemented many AARCH64 Neon instruction semantics to improve decompilation.
++ Upgraded pcodetest framework scripts to python3 and improved command-line options.
+
+## Other Improvements
+ + Many calling conventions for various processors/compilers have been improved using the more flexible decompiler rules 
+ when the data types for parameters and return values are known.
+ + Upgraded many 3rd party dependencies to address potential bugs and CVE's, including jars for Bouncy Castle,
+ Apache Commons Compress, Apache Commons Lang3, Apache Commons IO, protobuf, and JUnit.
