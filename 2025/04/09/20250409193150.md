-<h2><a name="introduction">Introduction</a></h2>
-
-<P>
-The Ghidra Server is incorporated into the standard Ghidra software distribution. Simply unpack the 
-Ghidra distribution, configure the Ghidra Server and perform the OS-specific install and you should 
-have the server running in no time.
-</P>
-
-<P>
-The Ghidra Server utilizes the YAJSW Java service wrapper to launch the application and provides OS 
-specific scripts which enable the application to run as a service.
-</P>
-
-<P>
-<b>NOTE</b>: It is very important that only a single server instance is running against any given 
-server repositories directory.  This can be assured if only the default port is ever used.  
-The daemon/service mechanism assumes that only one instance of the service exists.  Attempting to 
-run a second concurrent instance may lead to difficulties and is not supported.
-</P>
-
-<P>
-<b>NOTE</b>: It is highly recommended that the installation files for Ghidra reside on a local drive 
-and that the intended Ghidra Server process owner is granted full access to the Ghidra installation 
-directory (this is frequently not the case for NFS/SMB mounted home directories). 
-</P> 
-
-<P>
-You may also refer to the <typewriter>InstallationGuide.html</typewriter> file within the 
-<typewriter>docs</typewriter> subdirectory for general installation information.
-</P>
-
-(<a href="#top">Back to Top</a>)
-<div style="border-top: 4px double; margin-top: 1em; padding-top: 1em;"> </div>
-<h2><a name="javaRuntime">Java Runtime Environment</a></h2>
-<P>
-The installation of a suitable Java Runtime Environment must be completed before installing or
-running the Ghidra Server.  Please refer to the Ghidra Installation Guide to identify 
-a suitable version.  Since the Ghidra Server is unable to interactively identify a Java installation
-at runtime it must rely upon the setting of JAVA_HOME, execution search PATH or the use of standard 
-Java installation locations.  It is important to consider the service execution environment which may 
-differ from the administrator who may be installing the service.  For this reason use of an installed 
-Java release may be preferable over one that is simply unpacked to an arbitrary location.
-</P>
-
-(<a href="#top">Back to Top</a>)
-<div style="border-top: 4px double; margin-top: 1em; padding-top: 1em;"> </div>
-<h2><a name="serverConfig">Server Configuration</a></h2>
-<P>
-Before installing and running the Ghidra Server, the <typewriter>server/server.conf</typewriter> 
-file must be modified to suit your particular needs.  Within this file, locate the lines labeled:
-<PRE>
-    wrapper.app.parameter.#
-</PRE>
-These lines correspond to a sequential list of server command line arguments - be sure not duplicate 
-a parameter number.  The comments within this file indicate the available command line arguments 
-which should be specified here based upon the desired user authentication, repositories directory 
-location and other associated options.
-</P>
-
-<P>
-It is highly recommended that you specify a repositories directory outside of your 
-Ghidra installation directory with an absolute path so that it may be re-used more easily with 
-future upgraded installations of Ghidra.  Due to the use of a filesystem 
-watcher service the use of a locally attached storage device is preferred and will also ensure
-the best performance.
-</P>
-
-<P>
-<b>NOTE:</b> The server may fail to start if the repository native filesystem does 
-not support the use of a filesystem watcher service.  This could occur if attempting to use a
-remotely-mounted filesystem which may lack the required event support.  The watcher service is used 
-in conjunction with command processing associated with the <b>svrAdmin</b> command.  If a running
-server fails to process queued <b>svrAdmin</b> command requests, the repository native filesystem 
-may be the cause.
-</P>
-  
-<P>
-When upgrading your Ghidra installation, you will need to copy your app parameters from your old 
-<typewriter>server.conf</typewriter> to the new <typewriter>server.conf</typewriter>.  Do not copy 
-the entire <typewriter>server.conf</typewriter> file as this may prevent the server from running 
-properly.  If running as a service, you must run the <typewriter>server/svrUninstall</typewriter> script 
-from the old installation before running the <typewriter>server/svrInstall</typewriter> script from the 
-new installation.  Using a non-default repositories directory outside your Ghidra installation
-will simplify the migration process.
-</P> 
-

-<div style="border-top: 4px double; margin-top: 1em; padding-top: 1em;"> </div>
-<h2><a name="serverLog">Server Logs</a></h2>
-
-<P>The Ghidra Server produces two log files, which for the most part have the same content.
-The service <i>wrapper.log</i> file generally resides within the Ghidra installation root 
-directory, while the <i>server.log</i> file resides within the configured <i>repositories</i> 
-directory.  When running the server in console mode all <i>wrapper.log</i> output is directed
-to the console.
-
-(<a href="#top">Back to Top</a>)
-<div style="border-top: 4px double; margin-top: 1em; padding-top: 1em;"> </div>
-<h2><a name="serverMemory">Server Memory Considerations</a></h2>
-
-<P>
-The Ghidra Server currently maintains an in-memory state for all repositories. We are aware that 
-this can limit the scalability of the Ghidra Server.  The maximum memory used by the process can be 
-set within the <typewriter>server/server.conf</typewriter> file by adjusting the following setting:
-<PRE>
-    wrapper.java.maxmemory
-</PRE>
-</P>
-
-<P>
-<b>WARNING</b>! There are currently no safeguards when insufficient memory is available to the Ghidra 
-Server and can cause severe failure if an out of memory error occurs.
-</P>
-
-<P>
-The following formula can be used to approximate an appropriate setting for this 
-<typewriter>maxmemory</typewriter> value where <typewriter>FileCount</typewriter> 
-represents the maximum number of repository files and <typewriter>ClientCount</typewriter> 
-is the number of active Ghidra clients connected at one time.
-<PRE>
-    wrapper.java.maxmemory = 16 + (32 * FileCount/10000) + (2 * ClientCount)
-</PRE>
-Example:
-<PRE>
-    100,000 files and 25 connected Ghidra clients
-    16 + (32 * 100000/10000) + (2 * 25) = 386
-    wrapper.java.maxmemory=772    <i>(2 * 386, see NOTE below)</i>
-</PRE>
-</P>
-<P>
-NOTE: Due to the dynamic memory demands on the server not considered by this calculation (e.g., open file handles, etc.), 
-the actual <i>maxmemory</i> setting used should be larger
-than the calculated value.  At a minimum, it is recommended that the calculated value be doubled, and a larger value
-may be appropriate based upon server loading.</P>
-<P>
-The Java VisualVM tool (if available for your host) may also be used to examine memory usage while 
-the server is running.  This tool is NOT provided with any Ghidra distribution.
-</P>
-
-(<a href="#top">Back to Top</a>)
-<div style="border-top: 4px double; margin-top: 1em; padding-top: 1em;"> </div>
-<h2><a name="dnsNote">Note regarding use of DNS (name lookup service)</a></h2>
-
-<P>
-Both Ghidra Server and client application make extensive use of forward and reverse network name 
-lookups.  If this service is not properly configured on your network and hosts, names may fail to 
-be resolved or in certain cases cause severe performance delays due to improperly serviced DNS 
-name/address queries.
-</P>
-
-<P>
-By default the server will attempt to identify an appropriate remote access IPv4 address which will
-be written to the log at startup.  In addition, the server will listen for incoming 
-connections on all IPv4 interfaces by default.  It is important to understand the difference between 
-the published remote access address and the listening address (i.e. interface) which are both
-configurable.  See the <typewriter>-ip</typewriter> and <typewriter>-i</typewriter> options in 
-the <a href="#serverOptions">Server Options</a> section for more details.
-</P>

-<div style="border-top: 4px double; margin-top: 1em; padding-top: 1em;"> </div>
-<h2><a name="userAuthentication">User Authentication</a></h2>
-
-<P>
-The Ghidra Server has been designed to support many  possible user authentication modes:
-
-<UL>
-	<LI><u>No authentication</u> - any user which has been added to the server may connect without 
-	password or credentials.</LI>
-	<br>
-	<LI><u>Local Ghidra password (<typewriter>-a0</typewriter>)</u> - passwords associated with 
-	each user added to the server are maintained in the <typewriter>users</typewriter> file located 
-	within the repositories directory. The user will be prompted for this password when connecting 
-	to the server.  The default password <typewriter>changeme</typewriter> is used when a user is 
-	first added or when the user is reset (see <a href="#serverAdministration">Server 
-	Administration</a>).  This default password must be changed by the user to avoid its expiration.</LI>
-	<br>
-	<LI><u>Active Directory via Kerberos (<typewriter>-a1</typewriter>)</u> - user authentication is
-	performed against your local Active Directory system using Kerberos to do so.  The -d&lt;ad_domain&gt;
-	argument is required to specify the domain name of your Active Directory system.
-	<p>
-	It is also possible to authenticate against your Active Directory system using LDAP.  See the
-	LDAP example when using JAAS -a4 mode.
-	</LI>
-	<br> 
-	<LI><u>PKI authentication (<typewriter>-a2</typewriter>)</u> - user authentication is performed 
-	using PKI user certificates.  When using this mode, the distinguished name (DN) for each user 
-	must be	associated with each server User ID (see <a href="#serverAdministration">Server 
-	Administration</a>).  In addition, each user must configure Ghidra with the location of their 
-	signing key/certificate keystore file (see <a href="#pkiCertificates">PKI Certificates</a> 
-	for more information). 
-	<p>
-	Please note that each user&apos;s certificate must be issued by a trusted certificate authority 
-	which has been properly added to the Ghidra Server&apos;s <typewriter>cacerts</typewriter> file.  See 
-	<a href="#pkiCertificateAuthorities">Managing PKI Certificate Authorities</a> for more information.
-	<p>
-    In an attempt to simplify the determination of user DN&apos;s, a log file 
-    (<typewriter>UnknownDN.log</typewriter>) records user DNs which are unknown.  After adding a 
-    user to the server, ask the user to attempt a login using their PKCS certificate.  This should 
-    result in their DN being recorded to this log file.  The server administrator may now copy the 
-    appropriate DN from this log file when assigning the DN for a user.
-	</LI>
-    <br>
-	<LI><u>JAAS - Java Authentication and Authorization Service (<typewriter>-a4</typewriter>)</u> - 
-	user authentication is delegated to the JAAS subsystem.  The -jaas &lt;config_file&gt; argument
-	is required to specify the JAAS config file.  The JAAS config file supplied (<i>server/jaas.conf</i>)
-	contains various example configurations which may be used to establish an 'auth' configuration 
-	section.  None of the example configurations use the 'auth' name so they will be ignored by default.
-	<p>
-	JAAS is architected similar to Linux/Unix PAM, where a named authentication configuration is possibly
-	composed of several different modules.  Ghidra's support of JAAS only handles single simple
-	JAAS modules that requests the name and password from the user.
-	<p>
-	Some known JAAS login modules:
-	<ul>
-		<li><u>com.sun.security.auth.module.LdapLoginModule</u> - allows authentication to an LDAP server.  There
-		is an example of using this module to authenticate against an Active Directory system in the
-		jaas.conf file.
-		</li>
-		<li><u>net.sf.jpam.jaas.JpamLoginModule</u> - (Linux/Unix server only) allows authentication against
-		the local PAM configuration.  You will need to download JPAM from SourceForce and install the
-		libraries in the necessary locations.  See the example in the <i>jaas.conf</i> file. 
-		</li>
-		<li><u>ghidra.server.security.loginmodule.ExternalProgramLoginModule</u> - spawns an external
-		program for each authentication request, and uses the external program's exit code as the indicator
-		of successful authentication.
-		<p>
-		There is an example (and non-useful) implementation of an external authenticator provided with
-		the Ghidra instalation called <i>server/jaas_external_program.example.sh</i>.
-		<p>
-		This login module strives to be compatible with Apache's mod_authnz_external API, and you should
-		be able to use any mod_authnz_external authenticator with Ghidra.
-		<p>
-		The external program is fed the username\n and password\n on its STDIN (ie. two text lines).
-		The external authenticator needs to exit with 0 (zero) error level
- 		if the authentication was successful, or a non-zero error level if not successful.
-		</li>
-		<li><u>com.sun.security.auth.module.Krb5LoginModule</u> - not recommended - this login module
-		is used in the -a1 Active Directory via Kerberos authentication mode, and as such you should use it that way.  
-		</li>
-	</ul> 
-	
-	</LI>
-	<br>
-	<LI><u>Use of an SSH pre-shared key (<typewriter>-ssh</typewriter>)</u> is supported as an 
-	alternate form of authentication when using Local Ghidra password (<typewriter>-a0</typewriter>).
-	This SSH authentication is currently supported by the Headless Analyzer only.  See 
-	<a href="#sshAuthentication">SSH User Authentication</a> for configuration details.</LI>
-</UL>       
-</P>
-
-(<a href="#top">Back to Top</a>)
-<div style="border-top: 4px double; margin-top: 1em; padding-top: 1em;"> </div>
-<h2><a name="sshAuthentication">SSH User Authentication</a></h2>
-
-<P>
-When the <typewriter>-ssh</typewriter> option has been included in conjunction with password based 
-authentications mode (<typewriter>-a0</typewriter> a user's SSH public key may be added to the server to facilitate 
-access by a Headless Analyzer.  An SSH public key file must be added to the server repository for 
-each user who requires headless SSH authentication.  The SSH public key file (e.g., 
-<typewriter>id_rsa.pub</typewriter>) must be copied to the <typewriter>repositories/~ssh</typewriter> 
-subdirectory to a file named <typewriter>&lt;username&gt;.pub</typewriter>.  Removing the file will 
-eliminate SSH based authentication for the corresponding user.  When creating the 
-<typewriter>~ssh</typewriter> subdirectory, it should be owned by the Ghidra Server process 
-owner with full access and any SSH public keys readable by the process owner.  Changes to the SSH 
-public key files may be made without restarting the Ghidra Server.
-</P>
-<P>Each user may generate a suitable SSH key pair with the <typewriter>ssh-keygen</typewriter> command issued from a
-shell prompt.  A PEM formatted RSA key-pair should be generated using the following command options:
-</P>
-<PRE>
-   ssh-keygen -m pem -t rsa -b 2048
-</PRE>
-<P>NOTE: Ghidra Server authentication does not currently support the OPENSSH key format which may be the default 
-<typewriter>ssh-keygen</typewriter> format (<typewriter>-m</typewriter> option) on some systems such as Ubuntu.  
-In addition, other key types (<typewriter>-t</typewriter> option) such as <i>ecdsa</i> and <i>ed25519</i> 
-are not currently supported.

-<B>WARNING!</B> <B>As of Ghidra 7.0 a new project/server storage implementation, 
-<typewriter>Indexed-V1</typewriter>, has been added which is not compatible with older versions of 
-Ghidra.</B>  The <typewriter>Indexed-V0</typewriter> filesystem storage allows longer filenames and 
-paths to exist within a project, while the <typewriter>V1</typewriter> version expands support to 
-facilitate some of the very large project/repository features introduced in Ghidra 7.0. Since the 
-legacy storage implementation (<typewriter>Mangled</typewriter>) used by older projects and repositories 
-is still supported, conflicting storage behavior may exist between a Ghidra project and its server 
-repository for long filename/path support. It is highly recommended that all server repositories and 
-associated projects be migrated to the new Indexed storage implementation in a coordinated fashion 
-after making a complete backup. All new Ghidra projects will utilize the new Indexed storage 
-implementation, so care should taken when creating shared projects with older repositories.
-</P>
-
-
-<P>
-<B>NOTE:</B> If using Ghidra 6.0.x, opening a project which uses the newer <typewriter>Indexed-V1</typewriter> 
-filesystem may cause the project storage to revert to the older <typewriter>Indexed-V0</typewriter> filesystem.
-</P>
-
-<P>
-A user may determine which storage implementation is used by a project by viewing the 
-<typewriter>Project Info</typewriter> display (via <typewriter>Project</typewriter> -&gt;
-<typewriter>View Project Info...</typewriter>). Local projects using the legacy <typewriter>Mangled</typewriter> 
-filesystem may be migrated to the new <typewriter>Indexed</typewriter> filesystem via this 
-<typewriter>Project Info</typewriter> panel. The status of Ghidra Server repositories storage can be 
-determined and flagged for migration via the <typewriter>server/svrAdmin</typewriter> script (described 
-in the <a href="#serverAdministration">Server Administration</a> section). Please note that any 
-migration to the <typewriter>Indexed</typewriter> filesystem storage is a one-way conversion so a 
-backup of your project or server repositories directory is highly recommended before proceeding.

+
+## Introduction
+The Ghidra Server is incorporated into the standard Ghidra software distribution. Simply unpack the 
+Ghidra distribution, configure the Ghidra Server and perform the OS-specific install and you should 
+have the server running in no time.
+
+The Ghidra Server utilizes the YAJSW Java service wrapper to launch the application and provides OS 
+specific scripts which enable the application to run as a service.
+
+__NOTE__: It is very important that only a single server instance is running against any given 
+server repositories directory.  This can be assured if only the default port is ever used.  
+The daemon/service mechanism assumes that only one instance of the service exists.  Attempting to 
+run a second concurrent instance may lead to difficulties and is not supported.
+
+__NOTE__: It is highly recommended that the installation files for Ghidra reside on a local drive 
+and that the intended Ghidra Server process owner is granted full access to the Ghidra installation 
+directory (this is frequently not the case for NFS/SMB mounted home directories). 
+
+You may also refer to the _InstallationGuide.html_ file within the _docs/_ subdirectory for general
+installation information.
+
+([Back to Top][top])
+
+## Java Runtime Environment
+The installation of a suitable Java Runtime Environment must be completed before installing or
+running the Ghidra Server.  Please refer to the Ghidra Installation Guide to identify 
+a suitable version.  Since the Ghidra Server is unable to interactively identify a Java installation
+at runtime it must rely upon the setting of `JAVA_HOME`, execution search PATH or the use of 
+standard Java installation locations.  It is important to consider the service execution environment
+which may differ from the administrator who may be installing the service.  For this reason use of 
+an installed Java release may be preferable over one that is simply unpacked to an arbitrary 
+location.
+
+([Back to Top][top])
+
+## Server Configuration
+Before installing and running the Ghidra Server, the `server/server.conf` file must be modified to 
+suit your particular needs.  Within this file, locate the lines labeled:
+```
+wrapper.app.parameter.#
+```
+These lines correspond to a sequential list of server command line arguments - be sure not duplicate 
+a parameter number.  The comments within this file indicate the available command line arguments 
+which should be specified here based upon the desired user authentication, repositories directory 
+location and other associated options.
+
+It is highly recommended that you specify a repositories directory outside of your Ghidra 
+installation directory with an absolute path so that it may be re-used more easily with future 
+upgraded installations of Ghidra.  Due to the use of a filesystem watcher service the use of a 
+locally attached storage device is preferred and will also ensure the best performance.
+
+__NOTE__: The server may fail to start if the repository native filesystem does not support the use 
+of a filesystem watcher service.  This could occur if attempting to use a remotely-mounted 
+filesystem which may lack the required event support.  The watcher service is used in conjunction 
+with command processing associated with the `svrAdmin` command.  If a running server fails to 
+process queued `svrAdmin` command requests, the repository native filesystem may be the cause.
+
+When upgrading your Ghidra installation, you will need to copy your app parameters from your old 
+_server.conf_ to the new _server.conf_.  Do not copy the entire _server.conf_ file as this may 
+prevent the server from running properly.  If running as a service, you must run the 
+`server/svrUninstall` script from the old installation before running the `server/svrInstall` script
+from the new installation.  Using a non-default repositories directory outside your Ghidra 
+installation will simplify the migration process.
+
+([Back to Top][top])
+
+## Server Logs
+The Ghidra Server produces two log files, which for the most part have the same content. The service
+_wrapper.log_ file generally resides within the Ghidra installation root directory, while the 
+_server.log_ file resides within the configured _repositories/_ directory.  When running the server
+in console mode all _wrapper.log_ output is directed to the console.
+
+([Back to Top][top])
+
+## Server Memory Considerations
+The Ghidra Server currently maintains an in-memory state for all repositories. We are aware that 
+this can limit the scalability of the Ghidra Server.  The maximum memory used by the process can be 
+set within the `server/server.conf` file by adjusting the following setting:
+```
+wrapper.java.maxmemory
+```
+__WARNING__! There are currently no safeguards when insufficient memory is available to the Ghidra 
+Server and can cause severe failure if an out of memory error occurs.
+
+The following formula can be used to approximate an appropriate setting for this `maxmemory` value 
+where `FileCount` represents the maximum number of repository files and `ClientCount` is the number 
+of active Ghidra clients connected at one time.
+```
+wrapper.java.maxmemory = 16 + (32 * FileCount/10000) + (2 * ClientCount)
+```
+Example:
+```
+100,000 files and 25 connected Ghidra clients
+16 + (32 * 100000/10000) + (2 * 25) = 386
+wrapper.java.maxmemory=772  (2 * 386, see NOTE below)
+```
+__NOTE__: Due to the dynamic memory demands on the server not considered by this calculation (e.g., 
+open file handles, etc.), the actual `maxmemory` setting used should be larger than the calculated 
+value.  At a minimum, it is recommended that the calculated value be doubled, and a larger value
+may be appropriate based upon server loading.
+
+The Java VisualVM tool (if available for your host) may also be used to examine memory usage while 
+the server is running.  This tool is NOT provided with any Ghidra distribution.
+
+([Back to Top][top])
+
+## Note regarding use of DNS (name lookup service)
+Both Ghidra Server and client application make extensive use of forward and reverse network name 
+lookups.  If this service is not properly configured on your network and hosts, names may fail to 
+be resolved or in certain cases cause severe performance delays due to improperly serviced DNS 
+name/address queries.
+
+By default the server will attempt to identify an appropriate remote access IPv4 address which will
+be written to the log at startup.  In addition, the server will listen for incoming connections on 
+all IPv4 interfaces by default.  It is important to understand the difference between the published 
+remote access address and the listening address (i.e. interface) which are both configurable.  See 
+the `-ip` and `-i` options in the [Server Options](#server-options) section for more details.
+
+([Back to Top][top])
+
+## User Authentication
+The Ghidra Server has been designed to support many  possible user authentication modes:
+* __No authentication__: Any user which has been added to the server may connect without password or
+  credentials.
+
+* __Local Ghidra password (-a0)__: Passwords associated with each user added to the server are 
+  maintained in the _users_ file located within the repositories directory. The user will be 
+  prompted for this password when connecting to the server.  The default password _changeme_ is used
+  when a user is first added or when the user is reset (see 
+  [Server Administration](#server-administration)). This default password must be changed by the 
+  user to avoid its expiration.
+
+* __Active Directory via Kerberos (-a1)__: User authentication is performed against your local 
+  Active Directory system using Kerberos to do so.  The `-d<ad_domain>` argument is required to 
+  specify the domain name of your Active Directory system.
+  
+  It is also possible to authenticate against your Active Directory system using LDAP.  See the LDAP
+  example when using JAAS -a4 mode.
+
+* __PKI authentication (-a2)__: User authentication is performed using PKI user certificates. When 
+  using this mode, the distinguished name (DN) for each user must be associated with each server 
+  User ID (see [Server Administration](#server-administration)). In addition, each user must 
+  configure Ghidra with the location of their signing key/certificate keystore file (see 
+  [PKI Certificates](#pki-certificates) for more information). 
+  
+  Please note that each user's certificate must be issued by a trusted certificate authority which
+  has been properly added to the Ghidra Server's _cacerts_ file.  See 
+  [Managing PKI Certificate Authorities](#managing-pki-certificate-authorities) for more 
+  information.
+  
+  In an attempt to simplify the determination of user DN's, a log file (_UnknownDN.log_) records 
+  user DNs which are unknown.  After adding a user to the server, ask the user to attempt a login 
+  using their PKCS certificate.  This should result in their DN being recorded to this log file. The
+  server administrator may now copy the appropriate DN from this log file when assigning the DN for
+  a user.
+
+* __JAAS - Java Authentication and Authorization Service (-a4)__: User authentication is delegated 
+  to the JAAS subsystem.  The -jaas `<config_file>` argument is required to specify the JAAS config
+  file.  The JAAS config file supplied (_server/jaas.conf_) contains various example configurations 
+  which may be used to establish an 'auth' configuration section.  None of the example 
+  configurations use the 'auth' name so they will be ignored by default.
+	
+  JAAS is architected similar to Linux/Unix PAM, where a named authentication configuration is 
+  possibly composed of several different modules.  Ghidra's support of JAAS only handles single 
+  simple JAAS modules that requests the name and password from the user.
+
+  Some known JAAS login modules:
+  * __com.sun.security.auth.module.LdapLoginModule__: Allows authentication to an LDAP server. There
+    is an example of using this module to authenticate against an Active Directory system in the
+    jaas.conf file.
+  
+  * __net.sf.jpam.jaas.JpamLoginModule (Linux/Unix server only)__: Allows authentication against
+    the local PAM configuration.  You will need to download JPAM from SourceForce and install the
+    libraries in the necessary locations.  See the example in the _jaas.conf_ file. 
+  
+  * __ghidra.server.security.loginmodule.ExternalProgramLoginModule__: Spawns an external program 
+    for each authentication request, and uses the external program's exit code as the indicator
+    of successful authentication.
+	
+	There is an example (and non-useful) implementation of an external authenticator provided with
+    the Ghidra installation called _server/jaas_external_program.example.sh_.
+
+    This login module strives to be compatible with Apache's mod_authnz_external API, and you should
+	be able to use any mod_authnz_external authenticator with Ghidra.
+
+    The external program is fed the username\n and password\n on its STDIN (i.e., two text lines).
+    The external authenticator needs to exit with 0 (zero) error level if the authentication was 
+	successful, or a non-zero error level if not successful.
+		
+  * __com.sun.security.auth.module.Krb5LoginModule__: Not recommended. This login module is used in 
+    the `-a1` Active Directory via Kerberos authentication mode, and as such you should use it that 
+    way.  
+		
+* __Use of an SSH pre-shared key (-ssh</)__: Supported as an alternate form of authentication when 
+  using Local Ghidra password (`-a0`). This SSH authentication is currently supported by the 
+  Headless Analyzer only. See [SSH User Authentication](#ssh-user-authentication) for configuration
+  details.
+
+([Back to Top][top])
+
+## SSH User Authentication
+When the `-ssh` option has been included in conjunction with password based authentications mode 
+(`-a0`) a user's SSH public key may be added to the server to facilitate access by a Headless 
+Analyzer.  An SSH public key file must be added to the server repository for each user who requires 
+headless SSH authentication.  The SSH public key file (e.g., _id_rsa.pub_) must be copied to the 
+_repositories/~ssh/_ subdirectory to a file named `<username>.pub`.  Removing the file will 
+eliminate SSH based authentication for the corresponding user.  When creating the _~ssh/_ 
+subdirectory, it should be owned by the Ghidra Server process owner with full access and any SSH 
+public keys readable by the process owner.  Changes to the SSH public key files may be made without 
+restarting the Ghidra Server.
+
+Each user may generate a suitable SSH key pair with the `ssh-keygen` command issued from a shell 
+prompt.  A PEM formatted RSA key-pair should be generated using the following command options:
+```
+ssh-keygen -m pem -t rsa -b 2048
+```
+__NOTE__: Ghidra Server authentication does not currently support the OPENSSH key format which may 
+be the default _ssh-keygen_ format (`-m` option) on some systems such as Ubuntu. In addition, other 
+key types (`-t` option) such as _ecdsa_ and _ed25519_ are not currently supported.
+
+([Back to Top][top])
+
+## Server Options
+
+### Networking options
+
+#### `-ip <hostname>` 
+Identifies the remote access hostname (FQDN) or IPv4 address which should be  used by remote clients
+to access the server.  By default the host name reported by the operating system is resolved to an 
+IPv4 address, if this fails the local loopback address is used.  The server log will indicate the 
+remote access hostname at startup.  This option may be required when a server has multiple IP 
+interfaces, relies on a dynamic DNS or other network address translation for incoming connections. 
+This option establishes the property value for _java.rmi.server.hostname_.
+			
+#### `-i <#.#.#.#>`
+Forces the server to be bound to a specific IPv4 interface on the server. If specified and the `-ip`
+option is not, the address specified by `-i` will establish the remote access IP address as well as 
+restrict the listening interface. If this option is not specified connections will be accepted on 
+any interface.
+
+#### `-p#`
+Allows the base TCP port to be specified (default: 13100).  The server utilizes three (3) TCP ports 
+starting with the specified base port (e.g., 13100, 13101 and 13102). The ports utilized are logged
+by the server during startup.
+
+#### `-n`
+Enables reverse name lookup for IP addresses when logging (requires proper configuration of reverse
+lookup by your DNS server).  Please note that logging of host names is now disabled by default due
+to the slow-down which occurs when reverse DNS is not properly configured on the  network.
+	
+### Authentication options
+
+#### `-a#`
+Allows a user authentication mode to be specified (see [User Authentication](#user-authentication))
+
+#### `-d<ad_domain>`
+Sets the Active Directory domain name. Example: "-dmydomain.com"
+
+#### `-e#`
+Allows the reset password expiration to be set to a specified number of days (default is 1-day). A 
+value of 0 prevents expiration.
+	
+#### `-jaas <config_file>`
+Specifies the path to the JAAS config file (when using `-a4`), relative to the ghidra/server 
+directory (if not absolute).
+	
+See _jaas.conf_ for examples and suggestions. It is the system administrator's responsibility to
+craft their own JAAS configuration directive when using the `-a4` mode.
+
+#### `-u`
+Allows the server login user ID to be specified at time of login for `-a0` authentication mode. 
+Without this option, the users client-side login ID will be assumed.
+
+#### `-autoProvision`
+Enable the auto-creation of new Ghidra Server users when they successfully authenticate to the 
+server (`-a1` and `-a4` modes only). Users removed from the authentication provider (e.g., Active 
+Directory) will need to be deleted manually from the Ghidra Server using `svrAdmin` command.
+	
+#### `-anonymous`
+Enable anonymous access support for Ghidra Server and its repositories.  Only those repositories
+which specifically enable anonymous access will be accessible as read-only to an anonymous user.
+
+#### `-ssh`
+Enable SSH as an alternate form of authentication when using `-a0` authentication mode.

+## Running Ghidra Server on Microsoft Windows
+
+### Server Scripts (located within the server subdirectory)
+* __svrInstall.bat__: Installs server as service (_ghidraSvr_)
+* __svrUninstall.bat__: Removes previously installed server service
+* __svrAdmin.bat__: Facilitates Ghidra Server administrative commands (see 
+  [Server Administration](#server-administration))
+* __ghidraSvr.bat__: Provides a variety of commands for controlling the server when	running as a 
+  daemon process.  When running this script it accepts a single argument which is one of the 
+  following commands.  Many of these commands are included so that this script may be used for 
+  controlling the service.
+    * __console__: Starts server within the current terminal window. The _console_ argument may be
+	  omitted to allow for double-click execution in this mode.
+	* __start__: Starts the previously installed Ghidra Server service
+	* __stop__: Stops the installed Ghidra Server service which is currently running
+	* __restart__: Stops and restarts the previously installed Ghidra Server service
+    * __status__: Displays the current status of the Ghidra Server (_ghidraSvr_) service
+
+__NOTE__: The above scripts may be run from a _CMD_ window, or by double-clicking the script file 
+from an Explorer window.  Other than the console and status operation, elevated privilege is needed 
+to run these commands.  As such the user executing these scripts must be a member of the 
+Administrator group and must be run with elevated privilege.  If using Windows Vista or newer, the 
+best way to accomplish this is to run the _CMD_ shell using the _Run as Administrator_ action which 
+is available by right-clicking on a command shortcut or batch file.  If the _CMD_ shell is run in 
+this manner, the Ghidra Server scripts may then be executed within the shell to run with 
+administrator privilege.
+
+### Running Server in Console Window (intended for diagnostic use only)
+__NOTE__: Starting the server in console mode is generally intended for diagnostic use only.  
+Extreme care must be taken to ensure that any user who starts the Ghidra Server via this script 
+has full access to all directories and files within the root repository directory.
+
+If the Ghidra Server is not already running, it may be started within a console window by running 
+the `ghidraSvr.bat console` command.  When you wish to terminate the server, use the 
+`Ctrl-C` key sequence within the server console window and wait for a clean shutdown.
+
+### Install as Automatic Service (must have Administrator privilege)
+The Ghidra Server may be installed as an automatic service by executing the _svrInstall.bat_ script.
+This script may be run from a _CMD window, or by double-clicking the script file from an Explorer 
+window.  Once installed, the server will start automatically when the system is booted. Immediately 
+after running this script the service will not be running, you will need to either reboot or start 
+the service from the Service Control Panel.
+
+### Uninstall Service (must have Administrator privilege)
+If after installing the Ghidra Server as a service you wish to uninstall it, you may run the 
+_svrUninstall.bat_ script.  You must stop the service via the Service Control Panel prior to running
+this script.  This script may be run from a _CMD_ window, or by double-clicking the script file from
+
+__NOTE__: It is very important that you uninstall the service prior to doing any of the following 
+activities:
+* Deleting or upgrading the Ghidra installation
+* Moving/renaming the Ghidra installation directory
+
+([Back to Top][top])
+
+## Running Ghidra Server on Linux or macOS
+
+__NOTE__: macOS has limited support (see 
+[macOS - Service fails to start](#macos---service-fails-to-start-macos-1014-mojave-and-later)).
+
+### Server Scripts (located within the server subdirectory)
+* __svrInstall__: Installs server as service (_ghidraSvr_ or _wrapper.ghidraSvr_)
+* __svrUninstall__: Removes previously installed server service
+* __svrAdmin__: Facilitates Ghidra Server administrative commands (see 
+  [Server Administration](#server-administration))
+* __ghidraSvr__: Provides a variety of commands for controlling the server when	running as a 
+  daemon process.  When running this script it accepts a single argument which is one of the 
+  following commands.  Many of these commands are included so that this script may be used for 
+  controlling the service.
+    * __console__: Starts server within the current terminal window
+	* __start__: Starts the previously installed Ghidra Server service
+	* __stop__: Stops the installed Ghidra Server service which is currently running
+	* __restart__: Stops and restarts the previously installed Ghidra Server service
+    * __status__: Displays the current status of the Ghidra Server (_ghidraSvr_) service
+
+### Running Server in Console Window
+__NOTE__: Starting the server in console mode is generally intended for diagnostic use only. Care 
+must be taken to ensure that any user who starts the Ghidra Server via this script  has full access 
+to all directories and files within the root repository directory.
+
+If the Ghidra Server is not already running, it may be started within a terminal window by running 
+the command: `ghidraSvr console`.  When you wish to terminate the server, use the `Ctrl-C` key 
+sequence within the server console window and wait for a clean shutdown.
+
+### Install as Automatic Service (must have admin privilege)
+The Ghidra Server may be installed as an automatic service by executing the _svrInstall_ script. 
+Once installed, the server will start automatically when the system is booted.  If performing an 
+upgrade to an existing Ghidra Server installation you must uninstall the existing Ghidra Server
+first (see [Uninstall Service](#uninstall-service-must-have-admin-privilege)).
+
+In order for the installed service script to survive Java system updates, which may change the 
+installed Java version, it is highly recommended that the `GHIDRA_JAVA_HOME` variable be set
+properly at the top of the `ghidraSvr` script prior to the server install. `GHIDRA_JAVA_HOME` should
+refer to a non-changing path where Java is installed.  For a system-installed Java the major-version
+symblic-link path should be specified in favor of a full-version path which stipulates minor-version
+information.  In addition, it is important that the Ghidra Server service be restarted anytime the 
+installed Java version is updated where this symbolic link has been modified to reference a newly 
+installed Java version.  Failure to use this approach may result in the Ghidra Server service script
+referring to an invalid Java path following an update.
+
+Example setting of `GHIDRA_JAVA_HOME` within _ghidraSvr_ script:
+```
+GHIDRA_JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-21-openjdk
+```
+If it is preferred to run the service with a dedicated local user account, the following entry may 
+be added to the _server.conf_ file with the appropriate account specified in place of `<uid>`.
+A dedicated local service account should generally be a no-login account with a corresponding group 
+identifier with the same name (i.e., see _/etc/passwd_ and _/etc/group_). The local account should 
+be established and specified with server.conf prior to	installation of the Ghidra Server service. 
+```
+wrapper.app.account=<uid>
+```
+It is also important that the repositories directory and Ghidra installation files be owned by the 
+service account with proper permissions.  Note that while the Ghidra Server Java process will run 
+using the specified _uid_, the _wrapper_ process will continue to run as _root_ and monitor/manage 
+the Java process.
+
+### Uninstall Service (must have admin privilege)
+If after installing the Ghidra Server as a service you wish to uninstall it, you may run the 
+_svrUninstall_ script.
+
+__IMPORTANT__: It is very important that you uninstall the Ghidra Server service using the original 
+Ghidra software installation.  Use of a newer Ghidra software install may not properly uninstall a 
+different service version.  This is particularly true if uninstalling a Ghidra Server version prior 
+to 11.2.  Such an uninstall will be required when:
+* deleting or upgrading the Ghidra installation
+* moving/renaming the Ghidra installation directory
+
+__NOTE__: The service control mechanism for Linux changed with the Ghidra 11.2 release. The 
+_init.d_ mechanism was previously used in all cases, whereas the _systemd_ service mechanism may now
+used based upon YAJSW preference.  
+
+([Back to Top][top])
+
+## Server Administration
+The script _svrAdmin_, or _svrAdmin.bat_, provides the ability to manage Ghidra Server users and 
+repositories.  This script must be run from a command shell so that the proper command line 
+arguments may be specified.  This command should only be used after the corresponding Ghidra 
+installation has been properly configured via modification of the _server/server.conf_ file
+(see [Server Configuration](#server-configuration)) and installed and/or started.  
+
+Many of the commands are queued for subsequent execution by the Ghidra Server process. Due to this 
+queuing, there may be a delay between the invocation of a _svrAdmin_ command and its desired affect. 
+The Ghidra log file(s) may be examined for feedback on queued command execution (see 
+[Server Logs](#server-logs)).
+
+The general command usage is:
+```bash
+svrAdmin [<server-root-path>]
+         [-add <user_sid> [--p]]
+         [-grant <user_sid> <"+r"|"+w"|"+a"> <repository_name>] 
+         [-revoke <user_sid> <repository_name>] 
+         [-remove <user_sid>] 
+         [-reset <user_sid> [--p]] 
+         [-dn <user_sid> "<user_dn>"]
+         [-list  <user_sid> [<user_sid>...]]
+         [-list [--users]]
+         [-users]
+         [-migrate-all]
+         [-migrate "<repository_name>"]
+```
+
+#### `<server-root-path>`
+There is normally no need to specify this argument on the command line.The default server-root-path 
+is determined by the _server.conf_ setting of the `ghidra.repositories.dir` variable.  This allows 
+both the server execution and _svrAdmin_ script to utilize the same setting.
+
+#### `-add` (Adding a User)
+All authentication modes require that a user first be added to the server for a connection to be 
+permitted.  If Ghidra password authentication is used (`-a0`), the initial password is set to 
+"__changeme__". This password must be changed by the user within 24-hours to avoid its expiration 
+(password expiration period can be extended as a server option, see `-e` 
+[server option](#server-options).  Alternatively, the initial password may be specified by including
+the optional `--p` parameter which will prompt for an initial password.
+
+Examples:
+```bash
+svrAdmin -add mySID
+svrAdmin -add mySID --p
+```
+
+#### `-grant` (Grant Repository Access for User)
+Grant access for a specified user and repository where both must be known to the server. Repository
+access permission must be specified as +r for READ_ONLY, +w for WRITE or +a for ADMIN.
+
+Examples:
+```bash
+svrAdmin -grant mySID +a myRepo
+svrAdmin -grant mySID +w myRepo
+```
+    
+#### `-revoke` (Revoke Repository Access for User)
+Revoke the access for a specified user and named repository.  Currently, revoking access for a user 
+does not disconnect them if currently connected.
+
+Examples:
+```bash
+svrAdmin -revoke mySID myRepo
+```
+
+#### `-remove` (Removing a User)
+A user may be removed from the Ghidra Server and all repositories with this command form.  This will
+only prevent the specified user from connecting to the server in the future and will have no effect 
+on the state or history of repository files.  If a repository admin wishes to clear a user's 
+checkouts, this is a separate task which may be performed from an admin's Ghidra client.  Currently,
+removing a user does not disconnect them if currently connected.
+
+Example:
+```bash
+svrAdmin -remove mySID
+```
+
+#### `-reset` (Reset User's Ghidra Password)
+If a user's password has expired, or has simply been forgotten, the password may be reset to 
+"__changeme__".  After resetting, this password must be changed by the user within 24-hours to avoid
+its expiration (password expiration period can be extended as a server option). Alternatively, the 
+new password may be specified by including the optional `--p` parameter which will prompt for an 
+initial password.
+
+Example:
+```bash
+svrAdmin -reset mySID
+svrAdmin -reset mySID --p
+```
+    
+#### `-dn` (Assign User's Distinguished Name)
+The use of PKI authentication requires that each user's DN be associated with their user SID.
+
+Example:
+```bash
+svrAdmin -dn mySID "CN=MyName,OU=AGENCY,OU=DoD,O=U.S. Government,C=US"
+```
+__NOTE__: After having been added to the server, a user's DN may be copied from the _UnknownDN.log_
+file following an attempted connection with their PKCS certificate.
+    
+#### `-list` (List All Repositories and/or User Permissions)
+If the `--users` option is also present, the complete user access list will be included for each 
+repository. Otherwise, command may be followed by one or user SIDs (separated by a space) which will
+limit the displayed repository list and access permissions to those users specified.
+
+Example:
+```bash
+svrAdmin -list
+svrAdmin -list --users
+svrAdmin -list mySID
+```
+
+#### `-users` (List All Users)
+Lists all users with server access.
+
+Example:
+```bash
+svrAdmin -users
+```
+    
+#### `-migrate-all` (Migrate All Repositories to Use Indexed File-System Storage)
+For all repositories which are using the deprecated Mangled Filesystem storage, they will be 
+marked for migration to the Indexed Filesystem storage with support for longer file pathnames.  
+The actual migration will be performed when the Ghidra Server is restarted.
+
+Please note that any migration to the Indexed filesystem storage is a one-way conversion so a 
+backup of your server repositories directory is highly recommended before proceeding.
+
+Example:
+```bash
+svrAdmin -migrate-all
+```
+    
+#### `-migrate` (Migrate a Specified Repository to use Indexed File-System Storage)
+The specified repository will be marked for migration to the Indexed Filesystem storage with support
+for longer file pathnames.  The actual migration will be performed when the Ghidra Server is 
+restarted.
+
+Please note that any migration to the Indexed filesystem storage is a one-way conversion so a backup
+of your server repositories directory is highly recommended before proceeding.
+
+Example:
+```bash
+svrAdmin -migrate "myProject"
+```
+
+([Back to Top][top])
+
+## Repository Backup
+As with any server, it is highly recommended that your server repositories directory be periodically 
+backed-up or whenever an upgrade (or data migration) is performed.  While backups may be taken while 
+the Ghidra Server is idle (e.g., after midnight), it is always safest to stop the Ghidra Server 
+while a backup is in progress.
+
+([Back to Top][top])
+
+## Clearing Obsolete Checkouts
+Any user who has Admin privilege of a specific repository may use the Ghidra client to View 
+Checkouts for a specific file and Delete individual checkouts from those that are listed.  The 
+_View Checkouts_ action is available from the popup-menu of the Ghidra Project Window by 
+right-clicking on a specific project file.
+
+Under special circumstances (e.g., classroom environment) it may be desirable to remove all 
+checkouts either for a specific repository or an entire Ghidra Server.  Under Linux/Mac this is 
+most easily accomplished from the command shell while the Ghidra Server is stopped.  The following 
+command may be used:
+
+```bash
+find <repo-path> -name checkout.dat -exec rm {} \;
+```
+	
+where `<repo-path>` is the directory path of a specific named repository root, or the parent 
+repositories directory if clearing checkouts for all repositories.
+
+__WARNING!__ Since the `find` command is recursive, care must be taken when specifying the 
+`<repo-path>` and the other parameters.  If you specify the incorrect `<repo-path>` or omit the 
+correct `-name` argument, you may remove important files without the ability to recover.
+
+([Back to Top][top])
+
+## PKI Certificates
+PKI keys/certificates can be used to authenticate clients and/or servers. When using the Ghidra 
+Server PKI authentication mode this corresponds to "client authentication" which requires the 
+_server.conf_ to specify a _cacerts_ file location and each user client to configure a user signing
+key/certificate keystore file.  If clients wish to authenticate the server, the _server.conf_ must 
+specify a server key/certificate keystore file and each user client must configure a _cacerts_ file.
+See [Managing PKI Certificate Authorities](#managing-pki-certificate-authorities) for more 
+information on configuring a _cacerts_ file.
+
+User and server certificates must be acquired through one of many trusted authorities identified by 
+the _cacerts_ file installed by the peer system.  Your network support staff should be able to help
+you acquire a suitable signing key/certificate in the form of either a _*.p12_, _*.pks_, or _*.pfx_ 
+file.
+
+User's of the Ghidra GUI application can install their key/certificate file via the project window 
+menu item _Edit->Set PKI Certificate..._. The user will be prompted for their keystore password the 
+first time key access is required for a network connection after starting the application. If using
+the _analyzeHeadless_ script, see the _analyzeHeadlessREADME.html_ file for details.
+
+If the Ghidra Server will be installing a server certificate, the _server.conf_ file should be 
+modified to properly identify the server's key/certificate location (_ghidra.keystore_) and password
+(_ghidra.password_).
+
+([Back to Top][top])
+
+## Managing PKI Certificate Authorities
+When utilizing PKI authentication for a Ghidra Server a set of certificates for trusted Certificate 
+Authorities (CA) must be collected and added to a cacerts keystore file created using the Java 
+keytool.  The Java keytool can be found within the Java Development Kit (JDK) provided with 
+Ghidra (_java/bin/keytool_) or any other Java distribution.  The default cacerts keystore file 
+location is _Ghidra/cacerts_ and is also specified by the _ghidra.cacerts_ property setting within 
+the _server.conf_ file.  Uncomment this specification within the _server.conf_ file to activate use
+of the _cacerts_ for all incoming SSL/TLS connections (i.e., all Ghidra client users must install 
+and employ the use of their personal PKI signing certificate for both headed and headless use - see 
+[PKI Certificates](#pki-certificates)).  Clients can also impose server authentication for all HTTPS
+and Ghidra Server connections by creating the _cacerts_ file and enabling the _ghidra.cacerts_ 
+property setting within the _support/launch.sh_ and/or _support/launch.bat_ scripts.
+
+Individual CA public key certificates should be obtained in a Base64 encoding (see sample below). 
+If pasting the encoded certificate into a file, be sure to include an extra blank line after the 
+`END CERTIFICATE` line.
+
+Sample Base64 encoded certificate:
+```
+-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
+laSKCIElkjsudCUDusjSUkjeMSUjAJHDuLQWMCMausALkKXMXOOjSKSUjssjSKAA
+ksDSDjLKJHAuemCXXUmxxqjaskuDSYRmxiqgDlakkUSUdhemjASKUakjhuEhxMSD
+...
+ksJKDwocQwyeEIcbzHtyrSLfoeyGCmvbNLGHpgoruSTYQafzDFTgwjkJHCXVDjdg
+KDowiyYTXkcuiwCJXuyqCHpdoORriwwcCWUskucuwHDJskuejdkUWJCUDSjujsUE
+-----END CERTIFICATE-----
+```
+You can inspect the contents of a Base64 encoded certificate file with the following command:
+
+```bash
+keytool -printcert -v -file <base64file>
+```
+where:
+* `<base64file>` is the file containing the Base64 encoded CA certificate to be imported.
+
+The Owner common name (CN) displayed by this command should be used as the alias when importing the 
+certificate into your cacerts file.
+
+The following command should be used to add a CA certificate to a new or existing cacerts file:
+
+```bash
+    keytool -import -alias "<caAlias>" -file <base64file> -storetype jks -keystore <cacerts-file>
+```
+where:
+* `<caAlias>` is the name of the CA corresponding to the imported certificate.
+* `<base64file>` is the file containing the Base64 encoded CA certificate to be imported.
+* `<cacerts-file>` is the cacerts file to be used by the Ghidra Server (and/or client if needed).
+    
+The keystore password will be requested and is used to restrict future modifications to the 
+_cacerts_ file.
+
+When starting the Ghidra Server with PKI authentication enabled, the CA certificates contained 
+within the _cacerts_ file will be dumped to the log with their expiration dates.
+
+Please note that the Ghidra Server does not currently support Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs).
+
+([Back to Top][top])
+
+## Upgrading the Ghidra Server Installation
+1. Be sure to backup your projects and tools to ensure that the new Ghidra installation does not 
+   overwrite any of your data. Individual program files upgraded to a newer version of Ghidra 
+   can not be opened with an older version.
+
+2. Uninstall an installed Ghidra Server Service by following the _Uninstall Service_ instructions 
+   corresponding to your operating system 
+   ([Windows](#uninstall-service-must-have-administrator-privilege) or 
+   [Linux/macOS](#uninstall-service-must-have-admin-privilege)).
+    
+3. Unzip the new Ghidra distribution to a new installation directory (general unpacking and 
+   installation guidelines may be found in _ghidra_x.x/docs/InstallationGuide.html_).
+
+4. Copy the old _repositories_ directory to the new Ghidra Server installation directory.
+
+5. Copy the `wrapper.app.parameter.#` lines from your old _server/server.conf_ file to the new 
+   installation _server/server.conf_.  For 5.0 release and earlier, your old _server.conf_ file is
+   located within a platform-specific directory (`core/os/<platform>`). No other changes should be 
+   made to your new _server.conf_ file.
+
+   __Do not replace the new server.conf file with your old server.conf file, as this could cause 
+   server problems.__
+
+6. If desired, install the Ghidra Server Service from the new installation server subdirectory by 
+   following the instructions corresponding to your operating system 
+   ([Windows](#install-as-automatic-service-must-have-administrator-privilege) or 
+   [Linux/macOS](#install-as-automatic-service-must-have-admin-privilege)).
+
+__WARNING!__ __As of Ghidra 7.0 a new project/server storage implementation, `Indexed-V1`, has been 
+added which is not compatible with older versions of Ghidra.__  The _Indexed-V0_ filesystem storage 
+allows longer filenames and paths to exist within a project, while the `V1` version expands support 
+to facilitate some of the very large project/repository features introduced in Ghidra 7.0. Since the 
+legacy storage implementation (_Mangled_) used by older projects and repositories is still 
+supported, conflicting storage behavior may exist between a Ghidra project and its server repository
+for long filename/path support. It is highly recommended that all server repositories and associated
+projects be migrated to the new Indexed storage implementation in a coordinated fashion after making
+a complete backup. All new Ghidra projects will utilize the new Indexed storage implementation, so 
+care should taken when creating shared projects with older repositories.
+
+__NOTE__: If using Ghidra 6.0.x, opening a project which uses the newer _Indexed-V1_ filesystem may
+cause the project storage to revert to the older _Indexed-V0_ filesystem.
+
+A user may determine which storage implementation is used by a project by viewing the _Project Info_
+display (via _Project -> View Project Info..._). Local projects using the legacy _Mangled_ 
+filesystem may be migrated to the new _Indexed_ filesystem via this _Project Info_ panel. The status
+of Ghidra Server repositories storage can be determined and flagged for migration via the 
+_server/svrAdmin_ script (described in the [Server Administration](#server-administration) section).
+Please note that any migration to the _Indexed_ filesystem storage is a one-way conversion so a 
+backup of your project or server repositories directory is highly recommended before proceeding.

+
+## Troubleshooting / Known Issues
+
+### Failures Creating Repository Folders / Checking in Files
+If you see continuous failures to create repository folders or failures to check in files, check 
+the disk space on the server or folder permissions. When the server runs out of disk space, it 
+cannot create folders or check in files.
+
+### Client/Server connection errors
+The Ghidra Server has transitioned to using SSL/TLS connections when accessing the server's RMI
+registry.  This change in communication protocol can cause unexpected symptoms when attempting to
+connect incompatible versions of Ghidra.  When an older incompatible Ghidra client attempts to access a 
+newer SSL/TLS enabled Ghidra Server registry, the following connection error will occur:
+```
+non-JRMP server at remote endpoint
+```
+
+### MS Windows - ERROR Incorrect function (WindowsWatchService)
+The Ghidra Server employs a file system watcher service for the repositories directory which must 
+reside within a locally mounted NTFS or ReFS filesystem.
+
+### MS Windows - ERROR Missing Temp Directory
+Running the Ghidra Server as an installed service under Windows may attempt to use a non-existing 
+temporary directory (e.g., `C:\Windows\system32\config\systemprofile\AppData\Local\Temp\`). The 
+work-around for this is to configure the server to use an existing temporary directory (e.g., 
+`C:\Windows\Temp`).  This can be done by editing the _server.conf_ file, locate the 
+_wrapper.java.additional_ entries and add/uncomment an entry with your temporary directory 
+specified. For example:
+```
+wrapper.java.additional.3=-Djava.io.tmpdir=C:\Windows\Temp
+```
+Be sure to use the next unique sequence number for your _wrapper.java.additional_ entry.
+
+### MS Windows 7 and 8 - ghidraSvr.bat, svrInstall.bat, or svrUninstall.bat Error
+The following error may occur when attempting to install/uninstall/start/stop/restart the Ghidra 
+Server under MS Windows 7 or 8 even if the user is a member of the Administrator group:
+```
+Access denied: please check the user credentials
+```
+The user executing these scripts must be a member of the Administrator group and must be run with 
+elevated privilege.  The best way to accomplish this is to run the _CMD_ shell using the 
+_Run as Administrator_ action which is available by right-clicking on a command shortcut or batch 
+file.  If the _CMD_ shell is run in this manner, the Ghidra Server scripts may then be executed 
+within the shell to run with administrator privilege.  Failure to run the scripts in this manner may
+cause failure information to be hidden from view due to the privilege escalation mechanism.
+
+### Linux - SELinux must be disabled
+The Ghidra Server may not start properly if SELinux has not been disabled.  This setting is 
+specified in the file _/etc/selinux/config_.
+
+### Linux - Potential hang from /dev/random depletion
+SSL communications and the PKI/SSH authentication mechanisms employed by GHIDRA make use of the Java
+`SecureRandom ` class to generate random numbers required by various cryptographic techniques. On 
+Linux systems this class makes use of _/dev/random_ to produce these random numbers which in turn
+relies on other system entropy sources to feed it.  We have seen that _/dev/random_ can become 
+depleted which can cause the dependent Java application to hang.  While Java claims to have settings
+which should allow _/dev/urandom_ to be used, these security settings do not appear to work as 
+intended.  The best workaround we have found for systems which exhibit this problem is to install 
+_haveged_ (HArdware Volatile Entropy Gathering and Expansion Daemon) which will satisfy the entropy 
+demand needed by _/dev/random_.
+
+### macOS - Service fails to start (macOS 10.14 Mojave and later)
+The installed service may fail to start with macOS Mojave (10.14) and later due to changes in the 
+macOS system protection feature.  When the service fails to start it does not provide any error or 
+logging to help determine the cause.  Although granting _Full Disk Access_ to _Java_ can be a 
+workaround, this is rather drastic and is not considered desirable since it will allow any Java 
+application to run as root.  For this reason, installation of the Ghidra Server as a service on
+macOS is discouraged.
