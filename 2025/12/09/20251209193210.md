 * _Data Types_. Added `RGB16` and `RGB32` Color primitive datatypes which have been implemented as unsigned integer types and will render a color patch for Data within the Listing.  These default, respectively, to `RGB_565` and `ARGB_8888` encodings but can adopt a different RGB Encoding through the use of a Typedef and a default Setting. (GP-4310, Issue #6191)
 * _Decompiler_. Implemented low-pcode-based abstract interpretation via the Università Ca’ Foscari's Library for Static Analysis (LiSA). (GP-5566)
 * _Emulator_. Added an experimental Z3 Symbolic emulator with a summarization GUI. This feature is distributed as an installable extension. (GP-5727)
+* _FileSystems_. Add support for zstd compression in GFileSystem via user-provided zstd or 7-Zip command line tools. (GP-5842)
+* _Graphing_. Added a Function Graph tab to the Function Comparison widget.   This allows users to see two functions side-by-side in Function Graph views, such as when viewing BSim functions. (GP-3648, Issue #1154)
 * _Graphing_. Created a new prototype __Data Graph__ graphing feature with nodes that display data structures and values and edges that link one data structure to another via a pointer reference. (GP-5481)
 * _GUI_. Updated the Xrefs Table to allow the user to delete references to the current location. (GP-2140, Issue #4317)
+* _GUI_. Added a shared project repository connection status indicator to the root node of the project data tree.   A popup menu action was also added to the root node allowing the connection to be established when in a disconnected state. (GP-5333)
+* _GUI_. Added ability to toggle the displaying of function variables (parameters and locals) that are normally displayed just below the function signature. The variables display can be turned on/off globally or individually per function. (GP-5886, Issue #8385)
 * _Importer_. Created an importer for the Decompiler debug format which is produced by the Decompiler. (GP-3947)
-* _Importer_. Added a new loader for PA-RISC HP __System Object Module__ binaries. (GP-5942)
-* _Importer:COFF_. Added support for importing big-endian COFF binaries. (GP-5645, Issue #1398, #8042)
-* _Scripting_. Condensed the script categories into a better-organized subset of categories. (GP-3952)
+* _Importer_. Added an option to mirror the local filesystem when importing programs and their libraries. Programs and libraries that exist on the local filesystem as symbolic links will have both their corresponding link file and resolved program file mirrored in the project. (GP-5343, Issue #7430)
+* _Importer_. Added a new loader for HP-UX PA-RISC __System Object Module__ (SOM) binaries. (GP-5942)
+* _Processors_. Added support for the NDS32 Processor. (GP-6007, Issue #1778)
+* _Project_. Added expanded support for project link-files with the introduction of internal project folder and file links.  The links behave similar to Linux symbolic links and allow a single folder or file to be referenced by alternative project paths.   The GUI Project Tree and related project file chooser have also been improved with the ability to expand folder-links like folders (subject to filter restrictions at the API level).  The main Project Tree will continue to rely on project views for following external folder-links.  Some of the project tree's recursive traversal actions do not follow folder-links (e.g., Expand All).  NOTE: Although Ghidra permits files and folders to have the same name, this should be avoided when utilizing link-files or Ghidra URLs due to the path ambiguity it can cause.  This change also introduces a new file storage format which can create issues within a project if opened with an older version of Ghidra.  While this version remains compatible with older Ghidra Server versions, adding link files to a repository will require a Ghidra Server upgrade to the latest version. (GP-3551)
