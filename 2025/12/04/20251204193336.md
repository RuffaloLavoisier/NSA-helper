+## Project Data Link Files
 Support for link-files within a Ghidra Project has been significantly expanded with this release and
 with it a new file storage type has been introduced which can create some incompatibilities if
 projects and repositories containing such files are used by older version of Ghidra or the Ghidra 
 Server.
